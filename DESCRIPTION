Description: This package contains random notes about R code and using R that I created for myself.
  These notes didn't used to be in a package - they were just a folder full of random bits of code.
  However, the intent behind putting them into a package is to create vignettes with my notes that I
  can view from within RStudio even while I'm offline.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.2)
